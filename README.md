# Introduction

In Taiwan, over 12% of the population suffers from chronic kidney disease, with as many as 94,000 individuals requiring regular dialysis. Moreover, the number of dialysis patients increases annually at a staggering rate of 8,000 to 9,000 people, making Taiwan's prevalence of dialysis the highest in the world.

Hypotension during dialysis is one of the most common complications for dialysis patients. It not only affects the patients' quality of life but also increases the risk of arrhythmias, chronic or acute cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular ischemia. The occurrence of hypotension often leads to interruptions in the dialysis process, resulting in inadequate clearance of toxins and insufficient fluid removal, which can exacerbate the symptoms of uremia and heart failure over the long term. Previous literature has indicated that hypotension during dialysis is associated with increased mortality among dialysis patients.

However, hypotension during dialysis is preventable through various measures such as saline infusion, lowering the dialysate temperature, and increasing dialysate calcium levels. Therefore, our primary objective is to utilize a machine learning model to predict the occurrence of hypotension during dialysis in real-time and take appropriate actions to prevent it, thereby reducing the risk for patients during the dialysis procedure.

From past statistical data, we have observed a significant interaction between environmental temperature and patients' blood pressure. Therefore, we aim to incorporate temperature information using a time-series model to enhance the predictive outcomes of the model.
